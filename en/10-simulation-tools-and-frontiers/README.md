## Recommended Learning Path

1. First, read [ Simulation Platform Selection and Directory Guide ](01-simulation-configuration-document.md) to determine whether your task belongs to manipulation, navigation, system deployment, or cutting-edge platform research.
2. In the manipulation and reinforcement learning area: Learn [ ManiSkill Environment Simulation Configuration ](02-maniskill-environment-simulation-configuration.md), and then access [ ManiSkill Detailed Documentation ](../../10-具身智能其他仿真工具及仿真前沿/Maniskill详细文档).
3. In the high-fidelity rendering and system integration area: Study [ Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, and GR00T Deployment Guide ](01-isaac-deployment-and-gr00t-practices/00-isaac-deployment-navigation.md), and then select the appropriate path based on your local Windows, Linux workstation, cloud server, or GR00T reproduction target.
4. In the household task and complex interaction area: Learn [ Household Robot Environment Configuration ](04-household-robot-environment-configuration.md).
5. In the soft body manipulation area: Study [ SIM1 Soft Body Simulation and Data Generation ](09-sim1-soft-body-simulation-and-data-generation/01-sim1-environment-configuration-and-operation.md).
6. In the reinforcement learning training infrastructure area: Learn [ UniLab + MotrixSim Heterogeneous Robot RL Training Reproduction ](11-unilab-motrixsim-heterogeneous-rl-training/README.md), and understand how CPU physical simulation and GPU policy learning are separated.
7. In the humanoid full-body manipulation data area: Read [ HumanoidMimicGen Full-Body Planning Data Generation Guide ](12-humanoidmimicgen-full-body-planning-data-generation-introduction/README.md), and understand how a small amount of telemanipulation teaching can be expanded into policy training data through skill constraints, full-body planning, and randomization.
8. In the physical AI extension area: Read [ PhysicsNeMo Physical AI Solver Guide ](13-physicsnemo-physical-ai-solver-introduction/README.md), and learn about the differences between neural operators, PINN, and surrogate models and robot simulators.

## Environmental Requirements

The requirements vary greatly across different platforms. It is recommended to follow the configuration documents. Generally, it is necessary to:

- Python 3.8+ or platform-specified version.
- CUDA and NVIDIA drivers for GPU simulation or high-quality rendering.
- Dependencies corresponding to platforms such as MuJoCo, Isaac Sim, ManiSkill, and Habitat.
- NVIDIA GPU; higher memory configuration is recommended for complex rendering and large-scale parallel simulations.
